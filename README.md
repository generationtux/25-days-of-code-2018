# 25 Days of Code 2018 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to the 25 Days of Code, where the challenges are made up but their
solutions do matter. I've outlined some guidelines and an example to help get
things started. If you have any questions, please make a note [here](https://github.com/generationtux/25-days-of-code-2018/issues/new?title=Help%20Wanted&assignee=jlaswell)
and I'll follow-up.

## Guidelines

- Use whatever language you like for each challenge.
- Running `make` within the challenge folder will prove your solution.
    - Check the example `Makefile` in the 0-example folder for reference.
- Solutions must be run in a container.
    - Check the examples within the 0-example folder for reference.

## Getting started

1. [Duplicate this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/)

    - For example, mine would be jlaswell/25-days-of-code-2018.
2. Follow along with each day's challenge folder by copying the challenge README.md.
3. If you'd like, tag me in a PR or issue to confirm the solution. âœ…
