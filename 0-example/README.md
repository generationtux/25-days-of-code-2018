Each folder will have a README summarizing the challenge.

> Alice and Bob are engineers by day and shopping buddies by night. They want to

> To do this, they convert each message's character to it's corresponding
> character code and apply an XOR operation to the message using a shared key.
> This system allows them to use a single function to both encode and decode

Provide an example implementation of Alice and Bob's function using the
message "How many days until Christmas?" and the key "We could either watch it
happen or be a part of it."
