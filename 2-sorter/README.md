Santa likes to review the list in numerical order, but the elves build each list
by randomly assigning the next person or any list.

Write a function that helps Jingles merge the three numerically sorted lists
into a new sorted list for Santa to review.

Example: [1,4,9],[3,5,8],[2,6,7] â†’ [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Bonus: Can you sort into a new list without starting with an empty list?
