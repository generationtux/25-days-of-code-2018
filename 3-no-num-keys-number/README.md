# Day 3 - Number Without Number Keys

Can you believe that Jingles' number keys on his keyboard lost a fight to a jar
of syrup during some breakfast-time coding? (Yes, some elves keep their waffle
syrup in a jar but pancake syrup in a bottle.)

Help Jingles by writing a program that prints the number 2019 in any part of its
output without using any of the numbers: `0123456789`.

Bonus: Can you do so without using addition?
