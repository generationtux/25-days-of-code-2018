# Day 1 - Elevator

> Since last July, Santa has been working on maintaining his figure by exclusively using the elevator in the workshop tower instead of taking the stairs. Because Adna, Varen, and Morjeon enjoy pranking Santa, they have decided to replace the elevator control panel with their own.
>
> Jingles has already helped Santa to decode the buttons to help Santa navigate the 25 floors of the workshop, but Santa still wants to travel as efficiently as possible to help conserve North Pole power.

Looking at the control panel below, provide Santa with the most efficient combination to navigate to his desired floor between 0 and 25.

```
^  7     _  -7
#  3     *  -3
>  1     <  -1
```

Example: from floor 0 (the ground floor) pressing `^` followed by `#` takes Santa to the 10th floor; from there, pressing `<`, `*` takes him to the 6th floor.

Bonus: Can you provide a new function to help Santa navigate the records section between floors -25 and -1 as well as the workshop between floors 0 and 25?
