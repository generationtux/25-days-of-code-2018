# Day 5 - Snowball Pyramids

Professional snowball fights have strict rules and limits up in the North Pole.
One of the limits includes the available number of snowballs for each round of a
fight. Most games are 5 rounds, one minute each, where each round has a limit of
30 4" diameter snowballs available to each player. Snowballs are always stacked
in a pyramid shape behind each player in the field, where he or she restocks
from. For this traditional 5 round game, each player uses a 16"x16" base to
build his or her stockpile of snowballs.

Write a function that determines the required base size of a stockpile of n
snowballs.
