# Day 6 - Kinda Broken Printer

Certain floors of Santa's workshop contain prototype toys, sled parts, and more.
Before leaving for the day, the Chief Prototype Design Elf, prints 33
copies of a single 4 digit code to unlock the door for the next day.

Elves working here receive a copy of this special access code in his or her
mailbox at 2:00 AM each morning.

The printer seemed to have a bug while printing last night! Even though the code
was 0123, the printer kept printing seemingly random codes. Here are the first 5
codes printed.

0123
0746
1158
0129
4323

The CPDE discovered the printer was getting some part of the message correct
each time, so she just needed the team to figure out which character is most
frequent for each position. Write a program for the CPDE that will find the most
common character in each position.
